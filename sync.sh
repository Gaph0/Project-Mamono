# --- What gets deployed -------------------------------------------------
# Only what the game and the player need:
#   game content: About, Assemblies, Defs, Patches, Languages, Textures,
#                 Sounds, News, Settings, LoadFolders.xml
#   player docs : README.md, CHANGELOG.md
# Everything else in this repo is dev-only: Source, Tools, reports, plans and
# other *.md notes, build scripts, project files, backups, .git and hooks, IDE
# folders, Python venvs, art sources and zips.
# The list matches release.sh, so the deployed folder and the release zip hold
# the same files. --delete-excluded also removes dev leftovers from earlier
# syncs: plain --delete cannot, because rsync never deletes a path it has been
# told to exclude.
